Certainly! Below are example `README.md` files for both the Node.js server (Express.js) and the GraphQL server, which you can include in your project to provide documentation and instructions for developers.

### README for Node.js Server (Express.js)

```markdown
# Node.js Server with Express.js

This is a simple Node.js server using the Express.js framework. It provides a basic API to fetch a list of car details.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd node-express-server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **API Endpoints:**

   - `/cars`: Fetch the list of car details.

5. **Customization:**

   You can customize the server by modifying the routes and adding additional functionality as needed. The server uses Express.js, so you can refer to the [Express.js documentation](https://expressjs.com/) for more information.

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express.js

### README for GraphQL Server

```markdown
# GraphQL Server

This is a GraphQL server that provides an API to fetch a list of car details. It is designed to work with a frontend application to display car data.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd graphql-server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will be running at `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.

4. **API Endpoint:**

   - `/graphql`: Access the GraphQL API. You can use a tool like [GraphQL Playground](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/testing/graphql-playground/) to interact with the API and run queries.

5. **Schema and Resolvers:**

   - The GraphQL schema is defined in `src/graphql/schema.js`.
   - The resolvers are defined in `src/graphql/resolvers.js`.

6. **Customization:**

   You can customize the GraphQL schema and resolvers to add new queries, mutations, or types based on your application's requirements. Refer to the [Apollo Server documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) for guidance.

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Apollo Server (apollo-server-express)
